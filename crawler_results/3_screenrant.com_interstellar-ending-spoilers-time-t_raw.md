### Summary
  * Interstellar's ending includes complex concepts like time distortions and multi-dimensional spacetime. 
  * NASA's two survival plans involve harnessing fifth-dimensional physics or using human embryos for genetic diversity. 
  * Cooper sacrifices himself to save humanity through communication with future humans who manipulate spacetime. 


The **_Interstellar_** ending is still debated by fans years later. _Interstellar_ follows humanity's effort to find a new habitable planet after Earth is ravaged by environmental catastrophe. Former NASA pilot-turned-corn farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is brought on board the mission to save humanity, but it means he will have to leave his children behind on Earth while he is gone for years. As it turns out, the mission is far more complex than initially thought, with betrayals and mistakes made. Meanwhile, the answer to humanity's salvation is not what they expected.
Like many Christopher Nolan movies, _Interstellar_ presents a number of complicated story ideas that may be confusing for certain moviegoers — especially after a first viewing. There are big sci-fi concepts at play, from the environments of the different planets to the way Nolan plays with time. It all builds to an ending that ties everything together but it's not always easy to follow how it is all done. In order for some viewers to truly understand the _Interstellar_ ending, there is some further explanation needed.

###  Interstellar Sets Up The Final Generation Of Humans Who Can Survive On Earth 
Close
Early in the film, it's revealed that the US government has secretly been funding a NASA project to find humankind a new home, since **Earth in _Interstellar_'s version of the future is being ravaged by blight and can no longer sustain agriculture**. Cooper questions how NASA intends to find a planet capable of sustaining human life since humanity is already living on borrowed time, and transport to the nearest galaxy alone would take decades.
Professor Brand (Michael Caine) then reveals that an unknown civilization, which he refers to as "They," has strategically created a wormhole near Saturn — a wormhole that can serve as a shortcut to a distant region of space. As explained by Romilly (David Gyasi) in his impromptu paper hole example, humanity's understanding of distance is based on three dimensions, whereas theoretical physics suggests that space is a place of multi-dimensional interplay.
For that reason, the wormhole essentially functions as a bridge connecting two points in space by taking advantage of imperceptible fourth-dimensional space. By the time Cooper reunites with Prof. Brand, NASA has already sent 13 humans through the wormhole, each one on a mission to determine whether nearby planets (on the other side of the wormhole) can sustain human life.
Upon arrival at their planet, each of the astronauts was to set up a beacon, indicating that their planet was a candidate for human colonization. NASA cannot communicate directly with the astronauts but has been able to track their beacons for nearly a decade — of which only three remain active. As a result, it is up to Cooper and the rest of the Endurance crew to uncover the fate of the other three astronauts and collect any subsequent data that can be used to make an informed decision regarding which planet provides the best hope for humanity.

#####  6 Interstellar Theories That Change Christopher Nolan's $731 Million Sci-Fi Movie 
Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is a beloved film. For the past decade, audiences have theorized over the endless possibilities of its meaning.
Posts
##  The Plan For Survival In Interstellar 
###  NASA Develops Two Plans To Save Humanity 
Close
Should the Endurance team find a habitable planet, Brand claims that NASA has two plans for humanity's survival:
  * **Plan A:** While the Endurance team is away, Brand will continue to work on an advanced equation that, if solved, will allow humans to harness fifth-dimensional physics — specifically gravity. Should Brand succeed, NASA will be able to defy the traditional understanding of physics and **launch an enormous space station (carrying the remainder of Earth's surviving population) into space**. The very facility that Cooper and Murph stumble upon at the beginning of the film isn't just a NASA research station — it's a construction site for humankind's space-traveling ark. 
  * **Plan B:** Should Brand fail and/or the Endurance take too long investigating potential homeworlds, NASA harvested a bank of fertilized human embryos to be used to ensure humanity's survival — after everyone on Earth is wiped out. To ensure genetic diversity, NASA procured DNA from a wide range of sources so that future generations would not be limited to reproduction between Endurance members. In this scenario, **the team settles down on the most habitable planet and raises the first generation of embryos** with each subsequent generation helping to raise a new set of embryos (as well as reproduce naturally). 


Later it is revealed that Professor Brand never believed that Plan A was possible, stating that he solved the equation years back but it would not save them. He only **championed the idea in order to rally Earth leaders into working together and building the necessary infrastructure to ensure that, unknown to anyone but him, Plan B would be a success**. Brand reasoned that people would not have cooperated just to save humanity — they needed to believe that working together could lead to their own personal salvation.
##  Committing To Plan B In Interstellar 
###  Cooper's Sacrifice Saves Humanity 
Close
Upon learning that Plan A was a farce, Cooper and Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) commit to Plan B on their third (and final) planetary option, where Amelia's astronaut lover, Wolf Edmonds, was still reporting a positive beacon. Yet, Cooper remains unconvinced that Plan A is impossible and, as they use a nearby black hole (dubbed Gargantua) to slingshot Endurance toward Edmonds' planet, Cooper sends TARS (the crew's robot helper) into the center of the black hole in the hopes that it can translate data that might help NASA refine any missteps in Professor Brand's calculations.
Cooper also sacrifices himself to reduce weight on the Endurance, **ensuring that Amelia can make it to Edmonds' planet and enact Plan B should TARS fail**. However, instead of dying alone in space, Cooper is pulled inside The Tesseract — the gravitational singularity that is maintaining the wormhole — created by the aforementioned "They".
##  "They" In Interstellar Explained 
###  The Helpful Advanced Beings Are Not Aliens At All 
Close
Cooper and the other _Interstellar_ characters assume "They" are an advanced extraterrestrial (or supernatural) race who have unlocked the mysteries of dimensional manipulation. For some unknown reason, they decided to use this to help humankind escape their doomed planet. The NASA team believes the beings may be unable (or unwilling) to communicate directly with humans, specifically that "They" are fifth-dimensional, having transcended the three-dimensional ways of understanding the universe. Brand thinks "They" have laid out a series of rudimentary breadcrumbs (binary messages) and advanced technology (the wormhole) for humans to follow to save themselves from annihilation.
However, as revealed in _Interstellar_ 's final act, what NASA postulated was a single alien race is actually two separate but related entities:
  * Future humans who have mastered the laws of the universe, allowing them to manipulate time and space. 
  * Cooper attempting to communicate with his daughter inside the "Tesseract", which was built for him by the future humans. 


As a result, **most of the unexplained phenomena that NASA attributes to the beings are actually actions that Cooper takes in the future**. When Cooper sacrifices himself to ensure Plan B, he is caught in the black hole's gravitational pull but, instead of dying, ejects from his ship, landing inside The Tesseract (aka the wormhole's gravitational singularity) — a place where the laws of space and time become infinite.
Knowing their own past, specifically, the events that led to their salvation (and exodus from Earth),**it was humans who built the Tesseract at some point far in the future** and then, using their advanced knowledge of fifth-dimensional physics, manipulated spacetime to place the machine into the past (where NASA finds it orbiting Saturn).
Since Cooper and Murph are remembered as the saviors of humanity, **the fifth-dimensional humans, who can observe past, present, and future, custom-build The Tesseract for Cooper so that he can communicate with his daughter in the past and relay the data that TARS had collected inside the singularity**. To that end, the Tesseract is a filter that translates the fifth dimension into three-dimensional visibility (tuned to Murph's room), allowing Cooper to visit his daughter at any point in time (and "shake" Amelia's hand during the initial launch).
As with most time-travel movies, people will debate whether the plot results in an unexplained paradox (how did future humans _first_ survive to make a Tesseract - given that there would have been no Tesseract to save them), but Nolan leaves that particular detail up for post-viewing debate.
##  Time And Space Used Against The Mission In Interstellar 
###  The First Interstellar Planet Presents The Perils Of The Time Dilation Concept 
Close
_Interstellar_ is based on the ideas of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne — specifically the notion that while people observe the universe in three dimensions, there could be at least five dimensions. In certain theories, it is posited that certain forces (in this case gravity) bleed through dimensions, meaning that, based on Newton's Laws, what people perceive as a finite calculation could actually have infinite implications. Christopher Nolan movies often focus on time but _Interstellar_ is the greatest example of this. _Interstellar_ 's time distillation concept is outright exemplified in the first planet that the Endurance team visits.
In general, time on humanity's side of the wormhole moves faster than time on the uncharted side. **Due to proximity to gravitational anomalies from a nearby black hole (Gargantua), time on the other side is exponentially slower** — relative to the distance between an object and the black hole's gravitational pull. As a result, time on Miller's planet moves significantly slower — for every hour that the team spends on the water planet, seven years pass back home — the primary reason that Cooper is motivated to get off the planet as soon as possible (even before they realize it's a death trap).
Cooper knows that three hours on the planet's surface will cost him decades with his family. As Amelia suggests, the effect of gravity from the black hole on time was to blame for the Endurance team's unfortunate visit to Miller's planet in the first place, since what they perceived as years of positive beacon readings were actually mere minutes for Miller (who was killed by a wave moments after she landed).
The concept is further hammered home when, following the mission, Amelia and Cooper reunite with Romilly, who stayed behind on the Endurance to gather data (far from Gargantua), and, in the three hours his team was gone, has lived twenty-three full years alone without them. Similarly, the crew receives video messages from back home and Cooper's children, Tom and Murph have also aged from the beginning of _Interstellar_ 's timeline, and are now full-grown adults (played by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain, respectively).

#####  Interstellar: 20 Powerful Quotes That Make You Think 
the best Interstellar quotes offer deep insights into the minds of the main characters and delve into some fascinating ideas.

##  Time And Space As Humanity's Salvation 
###  How Cooper Communicates With Murph 
Close
A tangible effect of gravity on spacetime is also responsible for Cooper's ability to communicate with young Murph when inside the Tesseract. Inside the machine, gravity bleeds through to other dimensions in time and space, allowing Cooper to spell out a message ("S-T-A-Y") by pushing books off of Murph's shelf — or communicate map coordinates to the past version of himself by spreading dust across the floor (in binary language).
Most importantly, the fifth-dimensional communication through gravity (made visible by three-dimensional objects back on Earth) enables Cooper to gently manipulate the hands on Murph's watch, transferring the data that TARS acquired with morse-coded watch ticks. Subsequently, **translating that coded data gives Murph all the information she needs to drastically advance humanity's understanding of space and time** , as well as complete Plan A.
##  How Did Coop Survive & What Happens To Amelia? 
###  Cooper's Bittersweet Reunion With Murph 
Close
When it comes to how Cooper survives and reunites with Murph, Nolan simply applies the same theory that has been present the entire film. Given that time moves slower near the gravity pull of the black hole, **Cooper's ejection from the Tesseract is only seconds for him, but over half a century for the rest of humanity**.
If the ratio of time on Miller's planet was 1 hour for every 7 years on Earth, the proportion would be skewed exponentially at the absolute center of the Tesseract singularity. As a result, while it appears to Earthbound humans that TARS and Cooper have been floating out in space for nearly ninety years, they were actually only out there for mere seconds as they perceived it. The disproportionate relativity allows Cooper to survive and reunite with Murph, who, living on the faster-moving side of the wormhole, is now over 100 years old.
Knowing that Cooper has nothing left to live for in a post-Earth existence (since his son Tom is presumed dead and Murph will soon join him), Murph reminds her father that, through the wormhole, Amelia is just beginning to set up Plan B on Edmonds' planet. At the same time, it is revealed that even though Edmonds' planet is actually habitable, the astronaut himself did not survive the landing, leaving Amelia alone at the colonization site.
Using a reversal of the film's primary relativity theory, Cooper hops into a ship, with the knowledge that even though nearly 100 years have passed since the Endurance first set out, time on the other side of the wormhole is moving much slower — meaning that a second trip should allow him to reunite with Amelia on Edmonds' planet only a short time after Cooper first sacrificed himself and dropped into the singularity. The ending to _Interstellar _doesn't reveal if Cooper and Amelia reunite, but it certainly hints at a happy ending.
##  The Meaning Of Interstellar 
###  The Repeated Quote From Prof. Brand Sums Up The Movie 
Close
_Interstellar_ is a film about venturing into the unknown. Much like Nolan's mind-bending sci-fi drama. _Inception_ , the main takeaway from the end of _Interstellar_ is not that Cooper and Amelia will be reunited (though it's possible that they will). Rather the ending, and Cooper's departure to find Amelia, illustrates what Prof. Brand regularly suggested by way of poet Dylan Thomas:
"_Do not go gentle into that good night, old age should burn and rage at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."_
The movie seems to posit that humanity is at its best when people throw themselves passionately into the unknown in search of love and discovery. In the end, that is what Cooper intends to do.
##  How The Interstellar Ending Was Received 
###  The Reception To Interstellar Has Improved Over Time 
Close
_Interstellar_ 's ending was the subject of a lot of debate when the movie was first released, as well as a fair amount of criticism. While the overall reception was positive, it remains the second-lowest rated of Christopher Nolan's movies on _Rotten Tomatoes_ with 73%. Some of the criticisms leveled against the movie concerned the ending. While some felt _Interstellar_ lacked momentum following the climax, **others felt that the message Nolan was ultimately trying to communicate was overly sentimental.**
Cooper's line suggesting "love" is the key to saving humanity was often ridiculed for being sappy and corny, overshadowing many of the concepts of the movie's ending and reducing it to such a cliched idea. There was also a reaction among some viewers that, following everything that Cooper sacrificed, only being able to reunite with Murph at the end of her life, was an unsatisfying end for the characters. 
However, **more than any other of Nolan's movies, its reputation has greatly improved in the years since _Interstellar_ was released**. As more audiences found the movie and explored the big ideas, the ending began to be seen as a fitting culmination of the bold concepts. While the line about "love" is still an example of Nolan's clunky dialogue, many have recognized that it is not to be taken so literally, and it simply speaks to the connection Cooper has to Murph, which becomes instrumental in saving humanity.
There is a lot to take in with **_Interstellar_** and the ending throws several curves that take the story in a direction audiences might not have expected. In that regard, it is not surprising that it has taken some time for people to come around about how they feel about the film's conclusion.
