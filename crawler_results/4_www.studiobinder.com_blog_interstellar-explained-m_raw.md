There’s no doubt about it: _Interstellar_ was one of the most mentally-stimulating blockbusters of the 2010s. As such, a lot of people were confused about the _Interstellar_ plot, high-concept science, and bold ending. It’s time for _Interstellar_ explained – a deep-dive in which we answer some of the biggest questions audiences asked about the film. By the end, you’ll know the plot and meaning like the back of your hand; you might even say we’ll have an “interstellar explanation” for the fourth dimension.

## Interstellar Explanation
### Interstellar plot and summary
 _Interstellar_ is a 2014 movie that was directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan. The film received four Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing – and the VFX (Visual Effects) were so well regarded that they won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.
Although _Interstellar_ received good-not-great reviews upon release, it’s since garnered more acclaim and it frequently places on lists of the best sci-fi movies ever made.
_Interstellar_ is about Earth’s last chance to find a habitable planet before a lack of resources causes the human race to go extinct. The film’s protagonist is Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot who is tasked with leading a mission through a wormhole to find a habitable planet in another galaxy.
Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) explains to Cooper that NASA previously sent another group (Lazarus) to find a habitable planet but they’ve gone silent.
#### Interstellar Movie Meaning • Dr. Brand Explains the Plan
There are two plans in the  _Interstellar_ _plot_ _:_
  * **Plan A** involves Cooper transmitting quantum data back to Earth in order to develop a gravitational propulsion theory that will allow spacecrafts to carry people off Earth into the other galaxy.
  * **Plan B** involves Cooper’s crew finding the remaining Lazarus crew and establishing a colony on another world.


## Interstellar Summary & Setting
### When is Interstellar set?
We don’t know for certain when _Interstellar_ is set, but the script implies that it takes place in the not-so-distant future. We imported the _Interstellar_ script into StudioBinder’s screenwriting software to take a closer look at the film’s setting. This scene takes place near the beginning of the story and gives us a good hint at how many years in the future _Interstellar_ is set.
We can infer by way of deductive reasoning that _Interstellar_ takes place about 40-70 years into the future. How? Well, we know that Major League Baseball was still played when Donald was a kid. And we know that when Cooper was a kid, things were in such a state of disarray that no baseball was played.
So, if we assume that Cooper is about 40, and that things fell apart sometime before he was born, but not so far before that Donald didn’t live through a period of normalcy, then we can deduce that _Interstellar_ is set between the ages of Donald and Cooper — roughly 40-70 years from “modern time” of 2014.
## Water Planet - Interstellar Explained
### What happens on the water planet?
The Endurance crew decides to scout out Miller’s planet because it was the one that had most recently transmitted data to them. But since the planet is so close to the black hole, time is extremely dilated — every hour on the water planet is equivalent to seven years on Earth.
Cooper, Brand (Anne Hathaway), and Doyle (Wes Bentley) land on the surface and attempt to locate Miller’s transponder. But just as Brand finds the device, a massive wave rolls in, forcing the crew to flee to the courier ship. Doyle dies but Cooper and Brand narrowly escape — and Brand realizes that Miller must’ve died seconds before they arrived because of the severe time dilation.
## Cooper’s Family - Interstellar Explained
### What happens to Cooper’s family?
Cooper leaves his family – daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain), son Tom (Timothee Chalamet/Casey Affleck) and father in-law Donald (John Lithgow) – on Earth in order to lead the NASA mission. In his absence, his family develops a contentious relationship; but we don’t learn about it until Cooper does, 23 years into the future while watching old transmissions.
Murph and Tom become foil characters, aka characters who serve to expose attributes in each other. Murph becomes a NASA researcher who desperately wants to solve the gravitational theory to save the people on Earth while Tom takes over the family farm and largely rejects science and the reality of his situation. Their two opposing worldviews work against each other and expose negative and positive aspects of their character.
## Mann’s Planet - Interstellar Explained
### Where did Matt Damon come from?
Matt Damon plays the role of Dr. Mann, the captain of the Lazarus mission. After the failure of the water planet mission, Cooper is left with a difficult choice – go to Dr. Edmunds’ planet or Dr. Mann’s planet.
Let’s go back to the script to read through one of the best scenes – the one in which Cooper has to make the right decision in order to have any hope of executing the mission.
Cooper chooses Mann’s planet, taking the Endurance on a one-way trip to Matt Damon Town. When the crew arrives, they find Mann in cryosleep. It’s pretty much clear from the get-go that something is wrong with Mann – although considering the fact that he’s been in solitude/cryosleep for years, it’s not hard to see why.
But Mann has more than just a case of cabin fever, he’s full-blown bent on finishing the mission, no matter the cost.

## Interstellar Summary
### Plan A was a sham
Back on Earth, Dr. Brand reveals to Murph that Plan A was always a sham and there’s no way the people of Earth could ever escape.
#### Interstellar Meaning • Plan A Was a Sham
Murph transmits a message to Cooper accusing him of knowing Plan A wasn’t possible, effectively leaving her to die. Cooper tells Mann, Brand and Romilly that he’s going to return to Earth to be with his children and the rest of them can stay on Mann’s planet to start a colony.
But Mann’s planet isn’t hospitable – and he needs the ship to go to Edmunds’ planet. In this scene, Nolan intercuts between Cooper’s confrontation with Mann and Murph’s confrontation with Tom.
#### Interstellar Movie Plot Explained • Dual Confrontations
Murph burns all of the crops in order to make Tom understand he needs to leave the farm. Romilly is killed by a trap mine. Brand and Cooper barely escape back to the Endurance.
## Interstellar Summary
### What happens in the docking scene?
Brand and Cooper escape but they leave Mann behind. Mann foolishly attempts to dock in the Endurance; as a result his courier ship blows up and destroys key functions of the Endurance.
#### Interstellar Movie Meaning • Docking Scene
I love _Interstellar_ but, boy oh boy, we’ve got a cringe-worthy exchange of dialogue here:
TARS: Cooper, it’s not possible.
COOPER: No, it’s necessary.
Not great – but it’s hard to pick holes in a script as sharp as _Interstellar_. After some impressive piloting, Cooper successfully docks his courier ship in the Endurance.
## Interstellar Summary
### What is the Interstellar black hole?
The _Interstellar_ black hole is called “Gargantua” due to its gargantuan size. For more on how Nolan and the team made Gargantua with CGI (computer generated imagery), check out this awesome video.
#### Interstellar Theory • Building a Black Hole
When _Interstellar_ was released in 2014, there were no recorded images of a black hole. But in 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope took the first images of a black hole. This is what the central black hole of Messier 87 (a galaxy in the Virgo cluster) looks like.
![Interstellar Explained - Black Hole Messier 87](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/interstellar-explained-meaning-plot-summary/)
#### Messier 87 Black Hole via NASA
As it turns out, the scientists and visual artists who worked on _Interstellar_ were pretty close with the design of the black hole. But what is a black hole? To answer that question, we have to first answer the question: what is a wormhole? And to answer that, let’s watch a great analogical scene from the film.
#### Interstellar Movie Plot Explained • Wormholes
A common misconception is that black holes and wormholes are the same thing. But as Romilly (David Gyasi) explains, wormholes are like funnels that connect two distant points in spacetime. Hypothetically, objects could safely travel through a wormhole – but consequently, black holes are areas of spacetime that have such strong gravity that nothing can escape.
Note: I am not a PhD physicist and most of the astronomical science in _Interstellar_ is theoretical.

## Breaking Down the Interstellar Black Hole
### Interstellar black hole explained
I think the _Interstellar_ black hole scene is where a lot of people got lost. Up until that point, everything made a good amount of sense:
  1. Wormholes allow people to travel long distances through spacetime
  2. Differences in gravity and relative velocity cause time dilation
  3. Planets need key life-sustaining elements to be hospitable


But the _Interstellar_ black hole scene is where Nolan dove deep into theory – and there’s no way to tell whether he was “right” or “wrong” because we have no idea what exists beyond the event horizon.
The event horizon, as it relates to Einstein’s theory of relativity, is the point in a black hole where nothing can escape nor be observed. 
So, for _Interstellar,_ Nolan said, “Let’s send Cooper beyond the event horizon and see what happens.” Let’s look to the film to see what happened — it's abstract and minimalist but a truly thrilling sequence.
#### Interstellar Gargantua Explained
Many theoretical physicists believe that the event horizon serves as a barrier to the unknown physics of a black hole’s singularity. It could be compressed spacetime, antimatter, etc. In the case of _Interstellar,_ the singularity is a portal to the fourth dimension. But what is the fourth dimension? Let’s listen to Carl Sagan explain.
#### Carl Sagan Explains the 4th Dimension
So if we’re really trapped inside of a fourth dimension, how can we escape? Well, perhaps the answer exists beyond the event horizon.
## Interstellar Movie Explained
### Interstellar ending explained
How does _Interstellar_ end? In order to save Brand, Cooper slingshots around Gargantua to generate enough energy to send the Endurance to Edmunds’ planet. As a result, he slips into the black hole and beyond the event horizon. There, he finds himself trapped in the fourth dimension – a tesseract styled as a never-ending bookshelf.
#### Interstellar Ending Scene Explained
But Cooper realizes that he’s able to interact with Murph through spacetime. He asks TARS to relay the quantum data to him, which he communicates through morse code. Murph picks up on the morse code because she was fascinated by the gravitational anomalies in their house ever since she was a kid.
Turns out, those anomalies were caused by Cooper interacting through another dimension – sending himself on a mission to get the quantum data. Don’t just take my word for it – for more on the _Interstellar_ ending explained, let’s listen to Neil deGrasse Tyson.
#### deGrasse Tyson Interstellar Last Scene Explained
The questions raised in this scene aren’t just plot-filler, they’re some of the most profound questions in the universe – epistemological themes, or stances taken on how we understand the world are hallmarks of Christopher Nolan’s directing style.
## Interstellar Movie Explained (Continued)
### Interstellar ending explained: part II
After Cooper successfully communicates the quantum data to Murph, he’s kicked out of the tesseract. Some time later, he wakes up on “Cooper Station” – a space station that’s orbiting Saturn. There he finds Murph on her deathbed; having saved humanity from extinction with the quantum data. Let’s read through their final conversation together.
The _Interstellar_ meaning lies somewhere between astronomical science and intimate human connection. It’s simultaneously a story about traversing the stars and fighting for what you love. For many critics, it’s this dual-narrative structure that makes the story so good – even if it can be a little scientifically vague and cheesy.

  1. First off, this is a sham. Interstellar cannot be explained. Ranks up there with Unicorns and Rainbows. And the ‘cringeworthy’ dialogue that was mentioned I find needful and required, given the scenario, but that might be me. And thousands of others who quote that line on a daily basis. Lastly, it’s a movie, not real life. Just enjoy it. Sheesh.
  2. How do you explain Copper ending up in the Cooper land and everyone inhabiting the new planet? Not clear from the explanation.
  3. Really the movie is very interesting,give us the opportunity to think more deeply the universe system is working beyond the the formality of something we called past.
  4. I agree, makes you think and we do not know much about the universe.
  5. It’s so much deeper than that.
  6. It would have been a great movie if Brand (Anne Hathaway) character wouldn't have turned it into a soap opera with her dialogue on "feelings beats science" bullshit. Feelings don't belong in science and distort the reality, just look at how many people react illogically during this pandemic. You don't prove anything based on feelings in science, otherwise you turn it into something else: Religion.
  7. Great visuals and well acted but the plot is way more complicated than it needed to be and I don't think the movie excels at helping you follow it. I had to read a good synopsis afterwards and I was left shaking my head. IMO, the plot could have been simplified while still maintaining the same effect.
  8. Who’s to say feelings can’t be based on science.
  9. it was the soundtrack that led me to the movie. I have never seen such a science fiction that provokes emotion while simultaneously, telling a story about traversing the stars using astronomical science. I was emotional, not because I wanted to watch an emotional movie, but because I felt I could grasp the message which is a thin line between astronomical science and intimate human connection.
  10. Florin, Being that space travel does and will rely on humans for the foreseeable future, there was great reason to include human emotions and responses in the name of love in the movie. No matter how much technology is used, you can’t take out the human element. Yeah, I agree maybe they overdid it a bit, and Edmund was a bit of a tangent but feelings had an undeniable effect on the endurance’s mission.
  11. good summary
  12. Tq for good review
  13. if he had stayed, he wouldnt have saved the human race.
  14. i loved this film. i streamed it two nights in a row.. I am a little familiar with physics, and that definitely helped. but the gravity question (which they do solve by sending a probe over the event horizon and then relay the data back to earth, and via Dad, into her watch) was fascinating and also a great sequencing of an impossible riddle. The story lines were great as was the time/ merge with both events climaxing almost together. the space shots and the black hole — wow!!
  15. Incredibly thought provoking, and although most tend to not understand, the plot fillers while Cooper was within the fifth dimension gave such an emotional thrill ride. After crossing the event horizon, the scientific element isn't meant to be understood, because we aren't able to convey the unexplainable. But incorporating the fifth dimension to transmit a message, along with making it "home" to see his daughter before she died brought the emotional climax that was needed for a satisfying ending to this story. Now it's time for me to find part II.
  16. I found it just as the engine of 2001
  17. I think we can all agree that the movie was profound enough that it got you all into a conversation.
  18. This article had interesting analysis and helpful explanation of wormhole vs blackhole. One problem is that the name Romilly is thrown into paragraph with zero previous explanation as to who this character is. Same thing with Miller. You write they decide to "scout" out Miller's planet. Who is that? Zero prior explanation.
  19. Watched this movie back to back days but had actually seen it for the first time a few years back and I love it. These responses and questions posted in this thread are my exact sentiments about this movie. Some of this plot just can't be explained logically.
  20. Having seen interstellar in 2014, it left issues in my understanding of the universe and the space science connection.. Watching it again 10 years later, gave me a small insight to the puzzling question of time. In my youth (1960s) I was fascinated with science fiction. Dr Who and Star Trek…. in an episode of Star Trek, Spock views a planet evolving and developing, extremely quickly…the inhabitants on that planet surface, view the Enterprise fixed in space for centuries…. time was the answer.
