# The ending of Christopher Nolan movie ‘Interstellar’ explained
Joe Willams
Fri 7 July 2023 21:30, UK
In both the cinematic realm of Christopher Nolan and the pantheon of great science fiction, the 2014 epic  _Interstellar_ emerges as a brilliant synthesis of narrative complexity and profound thematic exploration. 
Central to the film is the journey of Joseph Cooper, portrayed by Matthew McConaughey, a farmer turned astronaut tasked with an immense responsibility – to find a new home for humanity as Earth teeters on the brink of an ecological catastrophe. The film is bold, both in its scale and ambitions, and whilst you’ll be hard-pressed to find critics of the movie, the ending still has some people scratching their heads.
Prompted by the mysterious guidance of what Murphy, Cooper’s daughter, refers to as her ‘ghost’, Cooper teams up with a team including Anne Hatheway’s character Brand and, of course, the obligatory turn from Michael Caine. Cooper and the gang (minus Caine) traverse the cosmos, propelled through a wormhole near Saturn and across the unfathomable expanses of space-time, only to confront the inescapable pull of a supermassive black hole named Gargantua. 
Cooper’s sacrifice, descending into Gargantua’s gravitational singularity, precipitates the film’s climactic and emotionally charged revelation. Rather than meeting a grisly end, Cooper finds himself in a ‘Tesseract’, a multi-dimensional space that’s initially thought to be created by aliens but is actually the construct of far-future humans so evolutionarily advanced that they can bend time to their will.
Inside this intricately woven tapestry of time and space, Cooper faces pivotal moments in his daughter Murph’s life. It dawns on him that these highly advanced future humans selected him as the medium to communicate the quantum data from within the black hole – data that is paramount to the survival of their species in the past. Cooper learns two things; that humans have been the ‘aliens’ all along and that his daughter’s ‘ghost’ was him in the Tesseract, interacting with her despite being separated by time and space. And interwoven throughout this narrative and scientific complexity is the resonating theme of love as an all-conquering, transcendent force in the universe, capable of shaping things at other corners of the cosmos. 
It is love, specifically Cooper’s love for his daughter, that becomes the beacon guiding him through the labyrinth of the Tesseract to convey the essential information that will save humanity. This life-saving information enables an adult Murph to crack the code of gravity manipulation, setting the stage for humanity’s great exodus from the dying Earth. Ejected from the Tesseract, which self-destructs, having served its purpose, Cooper is rescued near Saturn and awakens to a drastically new era. 
Time dilation has accelerated the years by decades, and he is reunited with his daughter, now a frail old woman on her deathbed. Old Murph reveals she spearheaded humanity’s escape, all thanks to the help of her father – both as the ‘ghost’ and as the pilot. Murph’s parting wish for her father is to seek out Hathaway’s character, who resides on a planet capable of harbouring life, trying to pioneer a new colony.
As _Interstellar_ draws to its close, Cooper and the loyal robot TARS commandeer a spaceship, setting the course for Brand. The ending, underscored by love’s victory over the vastness of time and space, illuminates the enduring human spirit – our indomitable will to survive, to love, and to continually reach out into the unknown, ever seeking, ever striving for knowledge and understanding in the infinite expanse of the cosmos.
